# Shopify-Backend-Summer22

# About
Inventory management web app built for the summer internship application process at Shopify. Frontend built in javascript(vanillla) backend built using Node.Js

# How to use
I deployed this project on netlify here https://anthonyvalenti-shopify.netlify.app for ease of use and to avoid any complications when attempting to pull the code to the reviewers/recruiters computer. The backend code is hosted using heroku. Since the backend code is being hosted on heroku, I decided not to use env variables to store the MongoDB URI and instead just removed the user/password fields to publish to Github.
